One portion of Sidetrack #1 that exhibited higher gas readings was noted
between 11,315’ MD and 11,355’ MD. Drillers noted torque and bit bound around
41,370’ MD that may indicate a fractured interval. Gas background levels and the size
of the connection gas and downtime gas spikes was greater following the events at
11,315’ MD to 11,355’ MD and 11,370’ MD. Sidetrack #1 was terminated when the
base of the Midale argillaceous zone was penetrated at a steep up angle.
SIDETRACK #2

Sidetrack #2 was started off of Sidetrack #1 to avoid the encounter with the
“tough drilling” basal Midale. Sidetrack #2 took off from Sidetrack #1 below the 3.5’ to 5’
“hard streak” and the first portion of Sidetrack #2 was drilled in the lower 10° to 12’
stratigraphically of the Nesson porosity. Gas readings were generally higher up to
11,700’ MD than the balance of the drilling of Sidetrack #2. This would seem to indicate
that the shows were better in the lower portion of the Nesson porosity as we reached
out beyond 3,500’ Vertical Section [VS] from the surface location. After tripping for a
fresh bit at 12,040’ MD, the well path was returned to the uppermost 3.5’ to 5’ of the
Nesson. Free oil was noted coming over the shale shaker screens following the bit trip
(associated with the trip gas). Samples recovered from Sidetrack #2 were generally
similar to those described above for Sidetrack #1, but becoming progressively smaller in

f size (milled up by the drill pipe while passing through the lateral portion of the hole) and
increasingly coated with free oil from the mud system. Some samples were little more
than an oily paste. In Sidetrack #2, one short excursion into the overlying basal Midale
was experienced and another close encounter (without drilling ail the way out of the
Nesson) was likely. Gas readings did depress somewhat with these “out of porosity”
encounters. Interpreted and Gamma Ray - documented top and bottom of zone events
are included in this report in a table that addresses “Dip Estimates’.
Sidetrack #2 was terminated when the legal “hardline setback” was approached, the
MWD batteries failed, and the basal Midale argillaceous marker was penetrated, all at
approximately the same time.
