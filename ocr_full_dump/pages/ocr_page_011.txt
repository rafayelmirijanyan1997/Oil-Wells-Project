STRIPPER WELL DETERMINATION

Dear Ms. Vogl]:
SM Energy Company (SM Energy) filed with the North Dakota Industrial Commission — Oil and
Gas Division (Commission) on September 12, 2011 an application for a Stripper Well Property
Determination for the above captioned well. .
Information contained in the application indicates that the above mentioned well is a property
pursuant to statute and rule, and SM Energy has elected to designate said well as a separate
property for stripper well purposes. The well produced from a well depth greater than 10000
feet. During the qualifying period, February 1, 2009 through January 31, 2010 the well produced
at a maximum efficient rate and the average daily production from the well was 26.5 barrels of
oil per day during this period.
It is therefore determined that the above captioned well qualifies as a “Stripper Well Property”
pursuant to Section 57-51.1-01 of the North Dakota Century Code. This determination is
applicable only to the Madison Pool in and under said property.
The Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction, and shall have the authority to review the
matter, and to amend or rescind the determination if such action is supported by additional or
newly discovered information. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me,
Sincerely,
David J. McCusker
Petroleum Engineer
