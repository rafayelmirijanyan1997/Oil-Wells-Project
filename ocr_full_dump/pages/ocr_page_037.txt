: Dear Ms. Torgerson:
* The application of Nance Petroleum Corp. for a Stripper Wel! Property determination was
: received July 28, 2003. The application requests that the Industrial Commission determine the following
‘ well in McKenzie County. North Dakota, to be a Stripper Well Property:
; . TiS3N, RIOIW
: Section 2 Well File #11745
4 Information contained in the application indicates that the land described above is a property
5 pursuant to Section 37-51.1-01(3) North Dakota Century Code (NDCC). However, during the twelve
5 consecutive months qualifying period March 2001 thru February 2002. The average daily production
: from the well, exceeds the maximum allowable production for stripper well status.
; It is therefore determined that the lands described above do not qualify as a Stnpper Well Property
: pursuant to Section 57-51.1-01 NDCC. The application is hereby denied.
The Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction, and shall have the authority to review the
* matter, and to amend or rescind the determination if such action is supported by additional or newly
e discovered information. If there are any questions, please do not hesitate to contact this office.
