i SUMMARY
The Basic Game & Fish #34-3H was successfully steered to a horizontal

penetration of the Nesson zone of the Mission Canyon Formation. The lateral exposed
a net 3,800! following the initial penetrations of the top of the Nesson. The vast majority
lateral is interpreted to have been drilled within the Nesson, in or stratigraphically near
the Nesson “porosity”. The Basic Game & Fish #34-3H required 21 drilling days or
approximately 206 drilling hours. The drilling operation generally went smoothly, with
few delays or problems. General sample quality (e.g. How representative were the
samples recovered ?) was rated as fair to poor due to very fine cuttings size out in the
lateral. The show quality in the lateral was fair to good, with obvious oil staining and
visibie open porosity.

CONCLUSIONS

1) A window was milled in the original 5.5" casing for directional sidetracking.

2) A significant show was encountered in the Ratcliffe, which persistently
produced gas during the drilling of the well.

3) The Nance Basic Game & Fish #34-3H was successfully steered to a
horizontal trajectory in the targeted Nesson zone of the Mission Canyon
Formation. Two open hole sidetracks were performed to keep the well
path in the target zone.

4) There were 3,800' measured depth feet drilled in the lateral following the
initial penetration of the Nesson. Of the total footage drilled after initial
penetration of the Nesson target 3,249’ (or 85.5%) were drilled in or very
near the targeted porosity streak, 68’ (or1.8%) were drilled just below the
target streak, and 483’ (or 12.7%) were drilled just above the ideal target.

5) Sample show and visual porosity estimates indicated fair to good
hydrocarbon production potential for the lateral. Fluid losses and free oil
in the mud and on the samples also indicate permeability and movable oil
phase.

6) The Nance Basic Game & Fish #34-3H awaits open hole completion in the
Nesson lateral following an acid stimulation with the drilling rig after TD.
