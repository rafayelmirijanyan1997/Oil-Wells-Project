3 Well File No. 11745

Dear Mr. Evertz:

‘ . Our o ffice has not received the digital .tif formatted file for the Drill Time-Sample-Mud Log

i Lateral #1, Sidetrack #1, and the Sidetrack #2.

i The North Dakota Administrative Code Séction 43-02-03-31 requires that all logs run by the

i operator shall be submitted as one paper copy and one electronic formatted file. All image logs,

3 which include the Drill Time-Sample-Mud Log, must be submitted as *.tif formatted files.

4 The Oil and Gas Division is aware that not all operators or contractors can generate electronic |

4 image logs as *.tif formatted files. In an effort to assist the Operator to comply with the North

4 Dakota Administrative Code, the NDIC Oil and Gas Division is providing a low cost option. In

4 lieu of the Operator submitting one paper copy and one digital *.uf formatted file for all image

: logs run on each well, you may submit two paper copies along with a $25.00 scanning fee for

3 each log to be scanned. In retum, the Operator will receive an electronic copy of each log

3 scanned as a TIF(*.tif) formatted file on a CD-ROM.

dq If you choose to have the NDIC Oil and Gas Division create the electronic file, I have included a

4 Request for Well Scanning Form for younconvenience.
