WELL EVALUATION
GENERAL
The Nance Petroleum Corporation Basic Game & Fish 34-3H was designed as a
horizontal development well for the Nesson member of the Mississippian Mission
Canyon Formation within the Baker Field. Baker Field is located in the U.S. portion of
the Williston Basin, in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The original Basic Game & Fish
34-3 was drilled directionally (due to surface restrictions on the Missouri River
floodplain) by Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. in late 1985, reaching total depth in the
Mission Canyon Formation (Mississippian in age), below the Nesson zone. A string of
5.5" production casing was run to total depth after electric logging, and the Nesson zone
was perforated and completed.
The original Game & Fish 34-3 was completed for 98 BOPD, 0 BWPD and 64
MCF gas per day. More recently, Nance Petroleum Corp acquired the well. Recent
production from the Basic Game & Fish 34-3 was 23 BOPD and 6 BWPD. The well has
Produced 224,525 BO, 107,142 MCFG and 6,623 BW through mid 2002.
Nance re-entered the Basic Game & Fish 34-3 and milled a window for
sidetracking operations in November 2002. The horizontal leg is refrred to as 34-3H.
The four primary offset wells used for corretation while drilling the Basic Game &
Fish 34-3H are:
1) the original open hole logs from the Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc.
Basic Game & Fish 34-3 (now owned by Nance Petroleum Corp.), with
the surface location 392’ FSL & 494’ FWL in the SW SW Section 2,
T153N, R101W, McKenzie Co., N.D.
2) the John L. Cox (now owned by Nance Petroleum Corp.) French-
Pinney #24-3, located 660’ FSL & 1,955’ FWL in the SE SW Section 3,
T153N, R101W, McKenzie Co., N.D. The French-Pinney was drilled
in 1987 and completed in the Red River Formation (Ordovician in age).
The French-Pinney IP’d for 276 BOPD, 486 MCFG, and 0 BWPD, and
has produced over 401,537 BO, 718,456 MCFG, and 193,009 BW.
3) the Nance Petroleum Corp. M&G #14-2 (originally drilled by John L.
Cox in 1987 as the Basic Game & Fish #14-2). The M&G surface
