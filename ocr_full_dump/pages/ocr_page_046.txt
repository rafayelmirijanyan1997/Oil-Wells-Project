: Sidetrack #1 was initiated at 9,460’ MD off of Lateral #1. Sidetrack #1
proceeded in zone, in the upper Nesson porosity, until drilling out of the top of the target
around 11,620’ MD. The decision was made to pull back and sidetrack “in zone”, rather
the waste the time and footage to drill back down to the target. Part of the difficulty with
recovering from drilling out the top of the Nesson is the poor “drill-ability” of the overlying
basal Midale argillaceous marker. “Sliding” (or directionally orienting the well path)
becomes very slow and unproductive. Steering is much more effective within the
Nesson porosity itself. The Sidetrack #1 was terminated at 11,680’ MD, at a position of
970.22’ North & 3,406.95’ West of the surface location. This calculates to a point
approximately 1,362’ FSL & 2,371’ FWL in the NE SW of Section 3.

Sidetrack #2 was initiated around 11,400’ MD off of Sidetrack #1. Sidetrack #2
proceeded “in zone” in the Nesson porosity, but initially at a deeper stratigraphic horizon
than Sidetrack #1. The early portion of Sidetrack #2 explored the lower 10’ of the 15°
gross Nesson porosity. A trip for a new bit was made at 12,040’ MD in Sidetrack #2.
Drilling of Sidetrack #2 proceeded after the bit trip mostly in the upper Nesson porosity
until several factors necessitated the termination of the drilling. These factors included
the approaching legal “hardline setback”, dead MWD batteries and the penetration of
the top the Nesson into the overlying basal Midale argitlaceous marker. Sidetrack #2
reached total depth at 12,800' MD. The Bottom Hole Location [BHL] at total depth in
Sidetrack #2 was 1,582.72’ North & 4,338.8' West of the surface location, at
approximately 1,975' FSL & 1,439’ FWL in the NE SW of Section 3.

: Re-entry and horizontal drilling of the Basic Game & Fish #34-3H took 21 days
and ~206 rotating hours. A total of 3,986.35 barrels of water were lost during drilling.
The Nesson laterals were left uncased for an acid stimulation and horizontal completion.
GEOLOGIC EVALUATION

The geologic evaluation of the Basic Game & Fish #34-3H began at the window
milling operation, stratigraphically above the top of the Ratcliffe member of the Charles
Formation (Mississippian in age), at 9,038' MD. Sunburst Consulting provided well site
geologists and a digital data gathering system. The digital gas information was
augmented by the use of a digital gas chromatograph. Drilling rig data (including ROP
[Rate of Penetration], on-off bottom status, and mud pump strokes) was received
through a digital connection to the rig EDR [Electronic Data Recorder]. The Sunburst
gas detection readings were returned for display and monitoring to the rig EDR.
Engineering and geologic data were then compiled and distributed on a digital drafting
and Internet communications system.

BUILD CURVE & LATERAL

After milling the window in the pre-existing 5.5" casing the directional portion of
the Basic Game & Fish #34-3H began. The KOP for the lateral was at 9,038' MD, just

f above the top of the Ratcliffe zone of the lower Charles Formation (below the Base Last

‘ Salt).
