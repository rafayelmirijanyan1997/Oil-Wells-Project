The Ratcliffe was encountered at 9,078' MD, 8,970' TVD, (-7107'). There was a
significant hydrocarbon show identified within the Ratcliffe interval between 9,114’ and
9,124’ MD. Gas peaked at 243 units [1% methane in air = 100 units] with large “heavy
gas” components (C3’s & C4s). Elevated backgound gas levels and large connection
and downtime gas spikes were recorded for the balance of the drilling of the Basic
Game & Fish #34-3H that are attributed (at least in part) to this zone. Samples
recovered from this Ratcliffe show interval included Limestone: light to occasional
medium brown, tan, very fine crystalline, occasional peloidal, occasional spotty black oil
stain, dull green fluorescence, slow streaming cut_in_part, poor to very poor
intercrystalline and interparticle porosity, occasionally anhydritic. These shows were
considered exceptional for the Ratcliffe interval in this area, and warrant further
investigation.

The Midale interval (also a member of the Charles Formation) was topped at
9,189’ MD, 9,056' TVD, (-7193'). There were only trace sample shows observed within
the Midale, with no significant gas increases over the high Ratcliffe background.

The top of the Mission Canyon Formation (Nesson zone) was reached at 9,350’
MD, 9,127.9' TVD (-7264.9') in the curve building portion of the lateral. Samples from
the initial contact with the Nesson porosity contained Limestone: tan, cream, very fine
crystalline, fragmental, occasionally peloidal, spotty black oil stain in vugs, yellow

f fluorescence in part, slow streaming cut in part, very poor interparticle and small pin

‘ point vuggy porosity, occasional white to clear anhydrite & calcite crystals. Surface oil
(free oil on the samples) was observed, probably coming from produced oil in the drilling
fluid (mud). A trip gas spike of 1,802 units was recorded when the steerable assembly
was tripped into the hole at 9,475’ MD. Due to an unexpectedly aggressive angle build
in the last portion of the curve build, the top of the Nesson was once again encountered
at 9,521’ MD, 9,127’ TVD as the well path moved back up stratigraphically.
SIDETRACK #1

Sidetrack #1 was initiated to avoid the sharp upward climb of the end of Lateral
#1. Sidetrack #1 remained predominately within the top 5’ of the Nesson porosity, and
oscillating between the top of the Nesson and the relative “hard streak” delineating the
base of the uppermost 3.5’ to 5’ (stratigraphically) of the Nesson porosity. The well path
did traverse up into the base of the Midale on two occasions, but it was possible to steer
back down into the targeted Nesson porosity. A tabulation of the encounters with the
top of the Nesson / base of the Midale and with the “hard streak” 3.5-5’ down from the
top of the Nesson is presented in the table “Dip Estimates”. Some of the recorded
events are based on Gamma Ray markers, while others (generally the “hard streak”)
are interpreted from drill rate and natural inflections of the well path. Samples from the
upper Nesson porosity were generally limestone: tan, cream, very fine crystalline,
fragmental, occasional peloidal, spotty black oil stain in vugs, yellow fluorescence, slow

/ to_fast streaming cut in part, very poor interparticle and pin point vuggy porosity, with
' some white to clear anhydrite and calcite crystals.
